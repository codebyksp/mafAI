                <strong>Welcome to MafAI!</strong><br><br>
                
                In this game, you and your friends will answer prompts while trying to figure out who among you isn't real. 
                One player will secretly be an AI trying to blend in!<br><br>
                
                <strong>How it works:</strong><br>
                1. Create a room or join one with a 4-letter code<br>
                2. The game consists of 3 rounds<br>
                3. Each round, everyone answers the same prompt<br>
                4. Try to sound like an AI to fool others!<br>
                5. Vote on who you think is the real AI<br>
                6. Score points for guessing correctly or fooling others<br><br>
                
                <strong>Scoring:</strong><br>
                • 100 points - Correctly identify the AI<br>
                • 50 points - Fool another player into voting for you<br><br>
                
                The player with the most points after 3 rounds wins!
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Inspiration:</strong><br>

                MafAI was inspired by the Turing test and designed to informally prompt 
                people about how they identify artificial intelligence in their day-to-day life and the way they interact 
                socially and creatively with each other. As AI becomes more present and 
                its use normalized in every aspect of our life, being able to detect what is and 
                isn't human becomes more of an essential skill, even more so as individuals become more overly 
                confident in their ability to recognize AI. By sparking the reflection through a fun and casual game, 
                MafAI makes the experience less intimidating to partake in and challenge's individuals' perspectives in a 
                way that encourages connection, friendship and curiosity.
